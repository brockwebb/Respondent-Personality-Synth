# Respondent Personality Synth
OpenAI GPT that creates synthetic 'personalities' based on demographics and other info provided. 

## Project Goal
The goal is to have a convenient method that survey methodologists and researchers can use to test survey response questions. Improved questions lead to better quality resonses. This testing tool isn't intended to replace humans in the field testing of questions, but to help make it faster and easier with less testing, cost, and other resources involved with survey preparation. 

A future project is the GPT that will use these to provide survey responses. However, the personality file could simple be uploaded as a reference to any LLM of your choice capabile of using it to adjust/tune responses with that synthetic persona. 

## Prompt Template
The [Prompt Tempate](https://github.com/brockwebb/Respondent-Personality-Synth/blob/main/persona-generator-prompt-csv.md) in this project can be cut & pasted into the GPT and modified according to your needs. 

## Usage
- The GPT is available on the OpenAI GPT Store: [Respondent Personality Synth](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-oLZoAz20f-respondent-personality-synth)
- The above prompt tempate is recommended for best results.
